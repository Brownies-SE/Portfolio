# Portfolio

# Description

This is my personal portfolio built using react. It is a single page application with multiple pages. The about me section provides an overview of my background and where I see my self in the future. The projects page uses a carousel to scroll through the more important projects I have done thus far. On each project there is a title and brand statement that link to the github and deployed application. The contact page has a form that uses mailto to open the users main email. The subject and body from the form are then put directly into the email so the user does not have to type it more than once
